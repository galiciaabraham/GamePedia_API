# Overview

Gamepedia is an API that allows you to perform CRUD operations with the different collections we have. 

The app has been built to demonstrate our skills to write an MVC application that includes its an UI with documentation.

# Development Environment

The application was built using VS Code, JavaScript, and Swagger for documentation. 

The app uses a connection to a MongoDB database.

# Future Work

* I tried to implement Nativewind, however some version issues and limitations related to not having an iOS system limited my ability to use it. I will check once the version errors have been fixed.  
* I will add camera and mic integration options so the user can record pictures, videos and audio records in the entries.
* The styling was kept in a basic stage because of time constrains, but I will improve it later on.
