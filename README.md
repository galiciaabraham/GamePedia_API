# Overview

Gamepedia is an API that allows you to perform CRUD operations with the different collections we have. 

The app has been built to demonstrate our skills to write an MVC application that includes its an UI with documentation.

# Development Environment

The application was built using VS Code, JavaScript, and Swagger for documentation. 

The app uses a connection to a MongoDB database. 

# Useful Websites

* [Mongo DB Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

# Future Work

* The entry URL doesn't give away what to do, when visited on a browser. This should give clear instructions on what needs to be done to access the api-docs page which contains the documentation.
* The use of session() keeps information on the localstorage that should be moved into a secured cookie.
* Additional features could be added such as filtering or organizing the data.
